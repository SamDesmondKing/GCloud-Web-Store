# GCloud Web Store for Customized Diaries

Cloud-based web store built using GCloud's WebApp2 framework (Python).

Built as a proof-of-concept - does not actually handle monetary 
transations. Features object persistence using Google Datastore,
and handles two different user types - Admin and Customer. Anyone 
can sign up for a customer account to take a look around the project.

This was build with a team of 5 for RMIT's Software Engineering Project 
Management subject. An Agile methodology (scrum) was used to manage and 
complete this project.
